# Compression
Compare between different types of lossless compression algorithms.
The comparison is done on both the compression ratio as well as the run time. The current list of algorithms is: LZ77, LZ78, and LZW.
I am after trying to make these algorithms HW friendly. 
Next steps:
1-	Parallelize the compression/decompression algorithms.
2-	Add more algorithms.
3-	Add different workloads and create different benchmarks. 
4-	Add machine learning aspect so see which algorithm should be used for which workload.
